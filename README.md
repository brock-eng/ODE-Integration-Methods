## ODE-Integration-Methods

This repository contains some test work implementing various integration schemes in python.  Problem.py can be run demonstrating comparing the accuracy of each model.

Integration schemes:
- Good old explicit euler
- Implicit euler
- Heun's method
- Runge-Kutta

Problem.py test systems:
- Transport problem
- Lorenz weather system
- Orbital mechanics
