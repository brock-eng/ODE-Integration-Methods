## ODE-Integration-Methods

This repository contains some test work implementing various integration schemes in python.  Also included is Problem.py which runs the various solvers on a few selected ODE systems.  Made using numpy and matplotlib.

Integration schemes:
- Explicit euler
- Implicit euler
- Heun's method
- Runge-Kutta

Problem.py test systems:
- Transport problem
- Lorenz weather system
- Orbital mechanics
