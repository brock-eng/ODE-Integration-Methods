## ODE-Integration-Methods

This repository contains some of the test work I've done implementing various integration schemes in python.  Problem.py can be run demonstrating comparing the accuracy of each model.

Integration schemes:
-Good old explicit euler
-Implicit euler
-Heun's method
-Runge-Kutta
